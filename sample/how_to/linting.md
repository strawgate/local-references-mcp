Linting is an important part of writing code. It helps you catch errors and make your code more readable. It also ensures that we use a consistent style across the project.

## Linting Rules

We use the following rules for linting:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use 140 characters for line length
- Use consistent spacing around operators
- Use consistent spacing around function arguments
- Use consistent spacing around variable assignments
- Use consistent spacing around function definitions
- Use consistent spacing around function calls
